Group Variables
You can set variables that apply to all hosts by using the playbook layout specified in Ansible's Best Practices document and creating a group_vars/all file where you define them.

---
# file: group_vars/all
ansible_connection: ssh 
ansible_ssh_user: vagrant 
ansible_ssh_pass: vagrant
