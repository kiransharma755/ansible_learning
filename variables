variable is very confusing in ansible. 
There are two cases how we can use variable. 

at the same level, there is a directory called vars.


---
- name: install tomcat
  hosts: all 
  remote_user: root 
#  include_vars:
#    - main.yml
  
  tasks:
    - name: include default step variables
      include_vars: main.yml
  roles:
    - tomcat
#   - test-tomcat
